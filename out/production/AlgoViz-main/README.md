# AlgoViz

Welcome to AlgoViz, an interactive program designed to help users understand sorting algorithms through entertaining animations.

## Introduction

AlgoViz is a Java-based interactive tool that visualizes various sorting algorithms, providing users with a hands-on way to learn and explore how algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and others work in real-time. Whether you're new to programming or a seasoned developer, AlgoViz offers an intuitive graphical interface to observe and understand sorting processes step-by-step.

## Features

- **Interactive Animations:** Watch sorting algorithms come to life with engaging visualizations.

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Choose from a variety of algorithms including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort.

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Experience sorting algorithms in action, with each step animated on the graphical display.

- **Adjustable Speed:** Control the speed of the animations to suit your learning pace.

## Getting Started

To get started with AlgoViz, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Venkateeshh/AlgoViz.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project:**
   Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse to open the project.

3. **Run the Application:**
   Locate the main Java file and run the application. This will launch the AlgoViz GUI.

## How to Use

1. **Launch the Application:**
   Upon starting AlgoViz, you will be presented with the interactive sorting visualization GUI.

2. **Select an Algorithm:**
   Choose a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort).

3. **Adjust Animation Speed:**
   Use the speed control feature to set the animation pace.

4. **Visualize Sorting:**
   Click on the "Visualize" button to initiate the sorting process. Observe the algorithm's execution in real-time on the graphical display.

5. **Explore and Learn:**
   After sorting completion, experiment with different algorithms or modify input data to further explore sorting concepts.
